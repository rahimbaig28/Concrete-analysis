# Predicting Concrete Compressive Strength

This project aims to predict the **compressive strength of concrete** using various components of its mix design, such as cement, fly ash, water, superplasticizer, and aggregates. The dataset used is publicly available on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets), consisting of 1,030 samples and 9 numerical variables.

## 🔍 Project Objective

The goal is to:
- Analyze the relationships between mix components and compressive strength.
- Build regression models to predict concrete strength based on input features.
- Identify key contributors to strength and derive meaningful engineering insights.

## 📊 What Has Been Done So Far

- **Dataset Exploration:** Loaded and examined the dataset for structure, missing values, and types.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
  - Correlation heatmap to detect linear relationships.
  - Histograms and boxplots to study distributions and outliers.
  - Scatter plots to examine trends between features and the target variable.
- **Initial Observations:**
  - Cement, Age, and Superplasticizer positively correlate with strength.
  - Water shows a negative correlation.
  - Some features exhibit skewness and zero-inflation.
  - Outliers are present but likely valid.

## 🚀 Next Steps

- Perform feature scaling and preprocessing.
- Train and evaluate machine learning models (Linear Regression, Random Forest, etc.).
- Analyze model performance using R², RMSE, and residual plots.
- Document findings and publish the paper with code and visuals.

## 📁 Dataset Description

Each row represents a concrete sample with the following columns:

- Cement
- Blast Furnace Slag
- Fly Ash
- Water
- Superplasticizer
- Coarse Aggregate
- Fine Aggregate
- Age (days)
- Strength (MPa)
